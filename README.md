Stupidly expensive acrylic stack fightstick
## You will need:
- 16x m4 screws
- 6x m4 hex standoffs that are long enough for however many middle bits you're using
- 11x 24mm buttons
- 1x Lever of some kind
- 1x Circular usb passthrough (like the silly qianrenon one on amazon)
- 1x Top panel
- 10x Middle panel if using 1/4" acrylic OR 20x if using 1/8"
- 1x bottom panel
- No respect for your time or money

**DISCLAIMER 
I have no idea if this will actually go together I ain't spending the money to build it lol**
